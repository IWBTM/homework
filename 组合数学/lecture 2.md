## 1.

for n+1 numbers, if each of two of them are differ by at least 2. The biggest will at least be $2^n$. 

When n>1, $2^n> 3n$ therefore confilct, so there is at least two numbers that differ by at most 2

### 2.

 a square can be separted into four small square, with the longest distance in the square is $\sqrt{2}$ . there are five point while there are only four square, which means there are at least two point in one small square, to the distance between is shorter than $\sqrt{2}$

## 3

we can choose 2-10 people in the ten people to divide into two groups. Therefore there are 

$(c(10,2)*(2^2-2)+c(10,3)*(2^3-2)+2^4-2+...+2^{10}-2)/2$
