## 4 (a).

  $5*7*3*2 = 210$





## 7.

 Firstly, make four man be seated, there are P(4,4) ways

 Secondly, make eight women be seated, there are P(8,8) ways

 so, the answer is $P(4,4)*P(8,8)$



## 19

Fristly, we choose 8 rows from 12 rows. There are $C(12,8)$ ways

Secondlg, we need to choose eight colum and sort it in the 12*12 chessboard . There are $P(12,8)$  ways.

Third, because there are five rooks are red and three rooks are blue, the number to place it is ${8!/(5!*3!)}$

so, the answer is $C(12,8)*P(12,8)*8!/(5!*3!)$



## 30

### (1). if there are only one parents

firstly, we arange 5 boys, P(5,5)/5

secondly, we arange 5 girls, P(5,5)

Thirdly, we arange the parents P(10,1)*P(2,2)

so, the answer is $P(5,5)*P(5,5)*P(10,1)*P(2,2)/5$

### (2). if there are two parents

if the two parents seat together, the answer is $A1=P(5,5)*P(5,5)*P(10,1)/5$

if the them seat separted,  the answer is $A2 = P(5,5)*P(5,5)*P(10,2)/5$

so ,the answer is $A1+A2$



## 61

### (1)

 that means if we have picked the position, the order of rooks is determined.

 so the answer is $1/9!$

### (2) 

firstly, we find the positon of red rooks in the board of 5*5, there are P(5,5) ways

secondly, we find the positon of blue rooks in the board of 4*4, there are P(4,4) ways

while the total ways is $A1 = 9!*9!/(4!*5!)$

so, the answer is $(5!*4!)/A1$
