## 2.

if b is a's predecessor, that means b is the biggest node in the nodes that smaller than a. If b has a right child c, that means a>c>b, it's wrong. So b has no right child.

if b is a's successor, that means b is the smallest node in the nodes that bigger than a. If b has a left child c, that means a<c<b, it wrong. So b has no left child.



## 3.

the worst-case runing time is $O(n^2)$ for the numbers is Sequential at the beginning.

the best-case runing time is $O(nlogn)$ for the middle value numbers at beginning.



# 第六章

## 1.

the larggest possible number is $2^{2k-2}-1$ when each floor is full.

the smallest possible number is $2^{k-1}-1$ when there is no red node.

# chapter7

## 1.

if a minimum degree of t=1,  that means there is no key in the node.

## 2.

only the root can not be rotated, so if there are $n$ nodes, there are exactly $n-1$ possible rotations

```python
def OS-KEY-RANK(T,K):
  if T->val==K:
    return T->left->size+1
  elif T->val>K:
    return OS-KEY-RANK(T->left,K)
  else
    return T->left->size+1+OS-KEY-RANK(T->right,K) 
```



## 2.

for each search, the cost of time is $O(lgn)$, for K times rearch, the cost of time is $O(klgn)$

but if we travel the whole tree, the max cost of time if $n$, therefore, the cost of time is $O(min(n,klgn))$

# chapter9

Using skip list to search node $y$ , in the same floor, find the first node $z<y$ from the node $x$, then get the previous node of $z$,  then go to the next floor from the node. We repeat the procedure untill we find $y$, the  time  cost is $lgk$.
