## 2.

if b is a's predecessor, that means b is the biggest node in the nodes that smaller than a. If b has a right child c, that means a>c>b, it's wrong. So b has no right child.

if b is a's successor, that means b is the smallest node in the nodes that bigger than a. If b has a left child c, that means a<c<b, it wrong. So b has no left child.



## 3.

the worst-case runing time is $O(n^2)$ for the numbers is Sequential at the beggining.

the best-case runing time is $O(nlogn)$ for the middle value numbers at beggining.
