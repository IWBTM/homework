## 1.2

T: play data2, to win the game

p: Percentage of opponents defeated

e: train with itself

target function：$v(b)=100$ if win

​							  $v(b)=-100$ if loss

representation of target funtion: $V(b) = w_0x_1+w_!x_2+w_3x_3+w_4x_4$

​															$x_1$ the count of killing

​															$x_2$ the count of death

​															$x_3$ how  much money the player has

​															$x_4$ how many tower the player hold

## 1.3

$E=\sum{(V_{train}(b)-V{(b)}}^2$ 

 $V(b) = w_0x_1+w_!x_2+w_3x_3+w_4x_4$

 $\frac{\partial{E}}{\partial{w_i}}=2(V_{train}(b)-V(b))\frac{\partial{V_{train}((b)-V(b))}}{\partial w_i}= 2(V_{train}(b)-V(b))(-x_i)$

​				 $w_i=w_i+(1/2\eta)\frac{-\partial E}{\partial w_i}$

Therefor,gradient descent is achievement by updating each weight in proportion to $\frac{-\partial E}{\partial w_i}$
