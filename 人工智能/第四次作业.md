a. hill-climbing search.

b. Each time it will generate successors of all nodes in the last level. This is breadth-first search

c. T=0 means it will not go to the worse node, which mean it is same with the hill-climbing search.

d. T=$\infin$ means random select the direction to search.

e.Genetic algorithm with population size N = 1: if the population size is 1, then the two selected parents will be the same individual; crossover yields an exact copy of the individual; then there is a small chance of mutation. Thus, the algorithm executes a random walk in the space of individuals.
