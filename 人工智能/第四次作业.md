a. hill-climbing search.

b. Each time it will generate successors of all nodes in the last level. This is breadth-first search

c. T=0 means it will not go to the worse node, which mean it is same with the hill-climbing search.

d. T=$\infin$ means random select the direction to search.

e.Genetic algorithm with population size N = 1: if the population size is 1, then the two selected parents will be the same individual; crossover yields an exact copy of the individual; then there is a small chance of mutation. Thus, the algorithm executes a random walk in the space of individuals.



## 4.2

Despite its humble origins, this question raises many of the same issues as the scientififi-

cally important problem of protein design. There is a discrete assembly space in which pieces

are chosen to be added to the track and a continuous confifiguration space determined by the

“joint angles” at every place where two pieces are linked. Thus we can defifine a state as a set of

oriented, linked pieces and the associated joint angles in the range [ 10, 10], plus a set of un

linked pieces. The linkage and joint angles exactly determine the physical layout of the track;

we can allow for (and penalize) layouts in which tracks lie on top of one another, or we can

disallow them. The evaluation function would include terms for how many pieces are used,

how many loose ends there are, and (if allowed) the degree of overlap. We might include a

penalty for the amount of deviation from 0-degree joint angles. (We could also include terms

for “interestingness” and “traversability”—for example, it is nice to be able to drive a train

starting from any track segment to any other, ending up in either direction without having to

lift up the train.) The tricky part is the set of allowed moves. Obviously we can unlink any

piece or link an unlinked piece to an open peg with either orientation at any allowed angle

(possibly excluding moves that create overlap). More problematic are moves to join a peg and hole on already-linked pieces and moves to change the angle of a joint. Changing one angle may force changes in others, and the changes will vary depending on whether the other pieces are at their joint-angle limit. In general there will be no unique “minimal” solution for a given angle change in terms of the consequent changes to other angles, and some changes may be impossible.
