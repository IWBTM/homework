a. if it has four colors, SA can choose 4 colors, so WA can choose 3 colors, NT can choose 2 colors, so is NSW and V. T can choose 4 colors. So it has 4x3x2x2x2x2x4=768 solutions

b. if it has two colors, there is no solutions.

## 6.4 b

For class scheduling, one possibility is to have three variables for each class, one with

times for values (e.g. MWF8:00, TuTh8:00, MWF9:00, ...), one with classrooms for values

(e.g. Wheeler110, Evans330, ...) and one with instructors for values (e.g. Abelson, Bibel,

Canny, ...). Constraints say that only one class can be in the same classroom at the same time,

and an instructor can only teach one class at a time. There may be other constraints as well

## 6.5

1. Choose the C1000 variable. Its domain is {0, 1}, C1000=1 and F=1, because F is the first digit.

2. The domain of C100 and C10 is {0,1}, let's choose C100=0,C10=0

3. So O, U,R are even numbers, we Choose T=8, so O=4, R=8,

4. because U is an even number, we choose U=6, W=3

   This is one solution

 ## 6.11

Weâ€™ll trace through each iteration of the **while** loop in AC-3 (for one possible ordering

of the arcs):

1. remove SA-WA, delete red from SA.
2. remove SA-V, delete B from SA, leaving only G
3. remove NT-WA, delete R from NT
4. remove NT-SA, delete G from NT, leaving only B
5. remove Q-SA, delete G from Q
6. remove NT-Q, delete B from Q, leaving only R
7. remove NSW-Q, and V-NSW,  SA-NSW, leaving no umber.

Therefore the the solution is wrong.
